                <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
                <p>This site contains all the information about the project for the course "Markup Languages".
                     The topic is about an application's settings. In my example, I used an application called "Strava"
                     which is basically a social sport activity tracker. The project consists of an XML file which describes
                     the settings of the application. There is also an XML Schema file for validation purposes and and an XSLT file
                     for transformation of the XML to JSON format. Finally, the JSON output file is also included.
                </p>

            <section id="methodology">
                <h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier the methodologies that are used are the following:
                    <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Technology</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td>XML</td>
                        <td>As a description language, i used XML in order to organize the data as clear as possible</td>

                        <td>XML Schema</td>
                        <td>The main purpose of this technology is to check if the XML file is organized well and according to the rules </td>

                        <td>XSL</td>
                        <td>XSL is used for transformation of the XML file to other forms like HTML or JSON</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>JSON</td>
                        <td>JSON, like XML is an easy way to display data in an organized way, easily readable by the user but also easy manageable by programming languages</td>
                    </tr>
                    </table>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the following table, are listed the platforms that were used for the implementation of the project:

                         Some of these elements are: units, default_sport, default_highlight_image. Again, some of these subelements
                         must have a specific string value such as Kilometers and Kilograms/Miles and Pounds.
                    </li>

                         The element hidden_locations contains sub elements of location type, each one of them having a specific ID as attribute.
                    </li>

                        <b>my_gear</b> : This element contains tags that refer to the user's gear. First sub elements are my_bikes and my_shoes.
                         Each of these elements contain subelements of bike or shoe type with specific attributes such as ID, status. There are also

                        the Strava account. Some attributes are app_id and access. The only sub element is the element name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>social_connections</b>: Finally, this element contains all the services that are connected with the Strava account. It contains
                        many sub elements with the type of service. There are some attributes like service_id and service_status that can only take specific values.
                        There are two sub elements of each element service. These are name and icon. Icon element also has attributes such as id and size.

                <p>Transformation was used to transform my XML document to a JSON one. </p>
                <p>
                    The XSL file contains some info and descriptions on how the file is supposed to transform.
                    I use items like [] for tables,{} for objects and "":"" for element-value combos. We can access 
                    element or attribute content using <b>xsl:value-of select=""</b>. I use <b>xsl:for-each</b> to loop into elements with many subelements
                    if the same type. I also use <b>xsl:if test="position() != last()"</b> after every loop in order to automatically decide if a comma(,) is needed.
